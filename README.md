This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing the UI and Test Server

1. Install Git & clone or download the repository to your machine: 

- Install Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
- Clone / download repository to your machine

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the /drakiri/drakiri-ui/ folder.

3. Make sure Node.js is installed and run the installer from the terminal prompt:

- Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Run npm install at the command prompt from the /drakiri/drakiri-ui/ folder:

> npm install

4. To get the web production UI for deployment, run the build:

> npm run build

This will compile the app and place it's index.html and site assets into the project's /build/ folder which should be copied unaltered to the web host's root or www folder.

5. To start the development server, run npm start and open a browser window to view the UI:

- Run npm start:

> npm start

- Open a browser and navigate to 'localhost:3000'


====


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
